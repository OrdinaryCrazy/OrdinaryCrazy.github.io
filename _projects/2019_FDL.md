title: Super-resolution of MDI magnetograms
subtitle: NASA FDL 2019
---

Over the past 50 years, a variety of instruments have obtained images of the Sunâ€™s magnetic field (magnetograms) to study its origin and evolution. While improvements in instrumentation have led to breakthroughs in our understanding of physical phenomena, differences between subsequent instruments such as resolution, noise, and saturation levels all introduce inhomogeneities into long-term data sets. This poses a significant issue for research applications that require high-resolution and homogeneous data spanning time frames longer than the lifetime of a single instrument.
